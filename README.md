## Project
I coded this mini app in order to work on my POO skills in Python.
I found this type of exercice good enough to review the basic and consolidate the fundamentals.
 + I'd like to try implementing that with Arduino in the nearest future ?

##  Improvements
- Saving orders to a file
- Removing items from the cart
- Quantity support
- A graphical menu
- A class‑based menu system
